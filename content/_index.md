Aviral Goel is a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Northeastern
University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). He is a member of the [Programming
Research Laboratory](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/), advised by [Professor Jan
Vitek](http://janvitek.org/). He received his Bachelors degree in Electronics
and Communication Engineering from [Netaji Subhas Institute of
Technology](http://www.nsit.ac.in/).

Aviral is interested in applying Programming Language tools and techniques to
data-driven evolution of mainstream programming languages. He is leveraging
empirical insights from large-scale code bases to retrofit new features to
[R](https://www.r-project.org/). He is helping [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
programmers write bug-free code by migrating the language from lazy-by-default
to lazy-on-demand semantics. He is also involved in the development of a type
system for [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Previously, he interned at [Oracle Labs,
Austria](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=LABS:location:0::::P23%5FLOCATION%5FID:26),
and worked at [National Center for Biological
Sciences](https://www.ncbs.res.in/) and [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/).
